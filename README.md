Hi, I’m Sylkos! (Jake K)

Mostly I just write java code for minecraft related reasons.

I've messed around a bit with C++, Mathematica, and R.

I'm currently rewriting my discord bot and trying to learn more about minecraft modding.

In the future I'd love to learn some Python and JS as well as continue to improve my skills in Java.

If you would like to contact me, the best way to do so is on discord at Sylkos#0540

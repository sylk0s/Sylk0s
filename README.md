Hi, Iâ€™m Sylkos! (Jake K)

Mostly I just write java and python code. 

I've messed around a bit with C++, Mathematica, and R.

I'm currently writing a discord bot (not even sure which one at this point) and focusing on smaller things while school is in session

In the future I'd love to learn some JS as well as continue to improve my skills in Java, Python and C/C++.

If you would like to contact me, the best way to do so is on discord at Sylkos#5840
